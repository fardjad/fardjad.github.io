  <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Fardjad Davari.
    I started my career professionally as a mobile application developer in 2011 but quickly realized that my passion is software architecture and backend development.
    These days I'm mostly focused on designing and implementing microservice architectures and REST services.
    I also enjoy working in Agile Software Development teams and Iâ€™m not afraid to face challenging problems.
