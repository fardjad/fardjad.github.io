  <p>
    I'm a pragmatic software engineer and a hands-on architect. I have a passion
    for socio-technical systems and collaborative software design. In my spare
    time, I learn new things, hack on personal side projects, help other people
    on Q&A forums like
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/{{ site.stackoverflow_username }}">
      StackOverflow</a
    >, play video games, and occasionally share notes and code snippets on
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">GitHub Gist</a
    >.
